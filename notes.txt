NOTES ON TESTING ONLINE:
    Since I need to test the code in an actual phone,
    Heroku will be used to deploy the code, the bank does not have
    a place to sandbox the testing ground so Heroku will do for now.
    It is the fastest to deploy and destroy. It will suit my need

    With that said, the development is in beta, which means that 
    no known entity can get a hold of it. For this purpose I will execute a script to deploy and destroy.
    Below is the sudo code for deploying and destroying the app.


    DEPLOY:
        Create a branch off from develop branch, must have a randomized name
        Delete the JS minifier
        Go through the heroku deployment, here is a ref(https://medium.com/@gge/deploy-a-meteor-1-3-application-to-heroku-cda1f68ca20a#.6lh58tbzg)
            -Probably need a randomizer for the name
